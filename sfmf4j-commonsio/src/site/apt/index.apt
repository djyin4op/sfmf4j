About SFMF4J :: Commons IO

    SFMF4J :: Commons IO is an SFMF4J provider for file system monitoring
    using Apache Commons IO.  This is strictly a polling implementation.

Configuration

    {{{./apidocs/com/github/sworisbreathing/sfmf4j/commonsio/CommonsIOFileMonitorServiceFactory.html}CommonsIOFileMonitorServiceFactory}}
    supports the following configuration parameters, which will be used in the
    construction of
    {{{./apidocs/com/github/sworisbreathing/sfmf4j/commonsio/CommonsIOFileMonitorServiceImpl.html}CommonsIOFileMonitorServiceImpl}}
    instances:

    [pollingInterval] the delay between file system polling attempts

    [pollingTimeUnit] the time unit for the polling delay

    []

    The default polling interval is 1 minute.  Changing these settings only
    affects newly-created instances of <<<CommonsIOFileMonitorServiceImpl>>>.
    Existing instances retain the polling intervals from when they were created.

* OSGi Configuration

    In OSGi environments (where <<<CommonsIOFileMonitorServiceFactory>>> is
    loaded through Blueprint), the polling interval is set through the Config
    Admin service.  The PID for Config Admin is <<<sfmf4j-commonsio>>>, and the
    Blueprint update strategy is <<<reload>>>.
